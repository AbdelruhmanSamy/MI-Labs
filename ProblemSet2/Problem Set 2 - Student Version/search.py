# If the maximum search depth is -1, then there should be no depth cutoff (The expansion should not stop before reaching a terminal state) 

# All the search functions should return the expected tree value and the best action to take based on the search results

# This is a simple search function that looks 1-step ahead and returns the action that lead to highest heuristic value.
# This algorithm is bad if the heuristic function is weak. That is why we use minimax search to look ahead for many steps.
